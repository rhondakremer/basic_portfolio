        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr width="940px" size="3px" color="lightgray">
        <p>I was born in Northern California and spent my childhood playing outside, riding horses, and writing stories. One day, I saw something shiny in a store window and had to have it! It was a trumpet and after begging my mom for lessons for several months, I began to play. This led me down an interesting path- I went to college in Chicago, then lived and played in Mexico for three years. I ended up in Miami in 2014 and have enjoyed being a part of the dynamic freelance culture here.</p>
        <p>Now I'm ready to try something new! I have spent most of my life blowing through a tiny metal hole but I am ready to learn a new and more practical skill, and have fun doing it! I am lucky to have my husband along for the ride :) I am enthusiastic and prepared to work hard and give web development my best shot.</p>
